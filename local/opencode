# Allow my repos
# If you have one or more specific directories where all the repos you want your agent to work with are located, whitelist them like this
# /path/to/repos/ r,
# /path/to/repos/** rwklix,
# /path/to/repos/**/* rwklix,
#
# Otherwise you might want to whitelist your whole home-directory.
# This is not recommended, as it will allow your agent to wreck havock in your home.
# But sensitive files in common locations are still denied by the policy, so it won't be able to use your ssh-keys, for example.
# /home/youruser/** rwklix,

# Explicit denies
# You might want to explicitely deny access to certain files
# deny /home/youruser/**/*.kdbx rwklx,

# If you selectively whitelisted certain repos, you can deny your agent to commit/rebase or otherwise destroy the local copy of your repository like this.
# It should be able to code, but you need to commit yourself. It will not be able to analyze any git history.
# deny /path/to/repos/**/.git/** rwklx,

# Deny various directories
# These are directories and files your agent should have no business messing with. But if you want to allow it, go ahead and remove those lines.
deny @{ONLY_HOME}/{Desktop,Documents,Downloads,Music,Pictures,Public,Templates,Videos}/** rwklx,
deny @{ONLY_HOME}/{snap}/* rwklx,
